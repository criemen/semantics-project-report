\subsection{Motivation}
TODO: as discussed above, the dataflow library reports 

% TODO intro
Programmers write functions in their code which change their behavior based on 
a Boolean parameter.
Then on the call sites, sometimes a Boolean literal is used to determine the behavior
of the subroutine.
For example in the Apache Hadoop project, almost 10000 instances of this
pattern occurred\footnote{\url{https://lgtm.com/query/139379883091955/}}.
In pseudo-code, the pattern looks like this:
% TODO better
\begin{minted}{java}
        fun A(bool param) {
            if(param) {
                // do X
            }
            else {
                // do Y
            }
        }

        fun B() {
            A(false);
            A(true);
        }
\end{minted}
Previously, the dataflow library didn't take these into account.


\subsection{Description of Implementation}
The implementation consists of N (TODO) different parts.
First, there is the predicate \texttt{isUnreachableInCall(Node n, DataFlowCall call)} which
computes the set of all nodes in the dataflow graph which are unreachable
TODO more
Second, 
% TODO mention virtual dispatch
\subsection{Correctness}
The correctness of the implementation is based on the observation that constants can be
inlined.

\subsection{Examples of code where detection is now improved}
\subsection{Future improvements}
The analysis described in this pattern can be further generalized, as
this pattern applies to more than just functions that take a Boolean parameter.
Boolean types are generalized by enumerated types, providing (usually) more than two options.
In fact, using an enum-typed variable over a Boolean variable can be the better from a software engineering perspective
even when just encoding a choice of two options.
Choices such as left and right are better represented 
by enum constants \texttt{LEFT} and \texttt{RIGHT}, rather than the 
non-descriptive Boolean constants \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}.

Looking again at the Apache Hadoop project, we see almost 1800
function calls\footnote{\url{https://lgtm.com/query/1789970986252448931/}} with enum constants as parameter.
In all these instances the enum parameter influences control flow in the function.

However, adding support for enum constants was not in the scope of the project, so we didn't implement it.
Furthermore, our architecture is designed to be easily extended.
Thus adding support for enum constant would be a mere software engineering effort
with no significant academic interest.
