    This project describes how a modern static analysis tool detects dataflow paths.
    We formalize the dataflow algorithm in a reduced language without support for procedure calls
    or objects in order to highlight how the dataflow library used by CodeQL works.
    We prove the soundness of the formalized algorithm with respect to a tracing semantics
    we developed.
    Then we describe the implementation of the algorithm in QL, as well as a small improvement
    that was contributed in the course of this project.
